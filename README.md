# Deep Learning Image Classifier
This project implements an image classifier on the Fashion MNIST dataset, exploring 
1. **Pre-defined models:** ResNet50, Inception V3
2. **Bespoke CNN models:** Built from scratch, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameter tuning

Our bespoke CNN model scored 91.8% on accuracy, which was better than ResNet50 and almost 10 times faster.
